# jira-carbonated
Fork of Jira Carbon userstyle with fixes for Jira Server. These fixes are needed to make all of the styles work on my instance of Jira Server v7.6.2.

Credit goes to <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/154743" alt="repartsrage Usertyles page">reptarsrage</a> for creating this theme.
